# bookstorewebscrape-and-analysis

This project demonstrates how to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data scraped from an online bookstore. The dataset was gathered using Python web scraping techniques and analyzed with tools like Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. The result: a set of interactive insights into book pricing, availability, ratings, and more.

# Tools & Technologies Used

- `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` â€“ for web scraping
- `pandas` â€“ data manipulation
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib` â€“ static visualizations
- `plotly.express` â€“ interactive charts
- `streamlit` â€“ interactive dashboard (optional)
- `sqlite3` or `sqlalchemy` â€“ SQL querying (optional)

#  Key Visualizations

- ðŸ“Œ Top 10 Most Expensive Books
- ðŸ“ˆ Average Price by Rating
- ðŸŸ© Book Availability Distribution (Pie & Donut Charts)
- ðŸ“‰ Rating vs Price (Scatter Plot)
- ðŸ“š Top Authors by Book Count
- ðŸ“¦ Histogram of Book Prices
- ðŸ§  Correlation Heatmap

# Key Insights

- A large majority of books are **in stock**, though some are consistently out of stock.
- **Price doesnâ€™t always correlate with rating** â€” some of the cheapest books have top ratings.
- A few authors publish **many titles**, indicating popularity or series.
- There is a **wide variance in pricing**, even among similarly rated books.
